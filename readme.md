This app depends on the [web2py framework](https://web2py.com),
and it's used at [道德經](http://daodejing.ca).
The app was built to study hanzi versions of the Dao De Jing in parallel
and to publish my English interpretations thereof.

The app contains examples
of how to use the [unihan](https://github.com/tessercat/unihan) database,
of how Python interpreters might share a common logger using the [zero](https://github.com/tessercat/zero) module,
and of how to use the [fwd](https://github.com/tessercat/fwd) XML-RPC server to manipulate firewall rules on localhost.
