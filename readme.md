This app depends on the [web2py framework](https://web2py.com),
and it's used at [道德經](http://daodejing.ca).
The app is very much purpose-built
to study hanzi versions of the Dao De Jing in parallel
and to publish my interpretations
thereof.

The app contains examples
of how to use the [unihan](https://github.com/tessercat/unihan) database,
of how Python interpreters might share a common logger
using the [rsyslog](https://github.com/tessercat/rsyslog) module,
and of how to use the [ufwd](https://github.com/tessercat/ufwd) XML-RPC server
to manipulate firewall rules on localhost.
