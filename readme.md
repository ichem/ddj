This app depends on the [web2py framework](https://web2py.com),
and it's used at [道德經](http://daodejing.ca).
The app is very much purpose-built
to study hanzi versions of the Dao De Jing in parallel
and to publish my interpretations
thereof.

The app contains examples
of how Python interpreters might share a common logger
using the [rsyslog module](https://github.com/tessercat/rsyslog),
or manipulate firewall rules
using the [ufwd XML-RPC server](https://github.com/tessercat/ufwd).
